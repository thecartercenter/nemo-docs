-----------------------

**To create a new Form**:

1. Click :guilabel:`Forms` menu.

**To add questions to the Form**:

**Form settings**:

By clicking on :guilabel:`More Settings` you can:

- Set a :guilabel:`Default Response Name` for the form:

  Text entered here will be used as the default name of filled forms in ODK Collect only (it is not reflected in NEMO OData.) By default, the response name will be the title of the form.
  
  You can enter $QuestionCode to include the value of a question in the form. 
  
  For example, entering: `Survey for $VillageNum-$Household`
  
  might name the form: *Survey for 7-Smith*

  This assumes you have questions with codes 'VillageNum' and 'Household'.

  You can also enter an XPath calculate expression by wrapping it with calc(): `calc($VillageNum + 100 div 2)`



- Check the :guilabel:`Allow Incomplete` box to allow forms to be submitted without required questions filled in.
